This is a schematic and PCB layout created with Kicad 5.1 for a snowflake with RGB LED's and wireless communication.

I have not had these PCB's manufactured, as I meant this as a hobby type thing and what I ended up with cost way more than I was willing to spend (the PCB is 6 layers, and even the cheap chinese pcb manufactures wanted several $100 USD to create the smallest bactch).

As a result of the above, I do not know how many mistakes I've made, or whether these will even work.  This is my first wireless PCB, and while I followed all the advice and recommendations I could find, I cannot make any claim as to how well its done.  If you use it as a basis for your own project, just keep that in mind, and understand I make no claims as to whether it will work.

At some point, I'd like to refine the actual snowflak shape, as its pretty rough (I imported from an SVG created in Inkscape).  Also, it'd be nice to have multiple possible shapes rather than just the one, as well as different sizes (the default size is about 126mm (4.9in) by 132mm (5.2in)).  For its size, there are a LOT of LED's (32 per PCB!).  Partly I wanted to be able to have plenty of light points, but it also allows the LED's to be run at lower power and provide considerable amount of light and complex color saturations, making sparkling a real possibility.
